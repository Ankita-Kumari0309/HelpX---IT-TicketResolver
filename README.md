## Key Features
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can submit IT issues in plain English.  
- **Automated Ticket Categorization**: AI agents classify tickets (e.g., Password Reset, Network Issue) for faster resolution.  
- **Knowledge Base Retrieval**: Uses vector similarity search to fetch the most relevant solutions from a curated knowledge base.  
- **Email Escalation**: Tickets unresolved by AI are automatically escalated to IT support.  
- **Interactive Streamlit UI**: Simple web interface for submitting tickets, viewing solutions, and providing feedback.
